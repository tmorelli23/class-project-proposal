    <h3>Application Overview</h3>

    <p>
        For this class project, I will be developing a unique countdown timer that 
        is implemented in the form of an hour glass.

<p>--->Technology Overview (languages, libraries, platforms, hosting)- I plan to use python to create the HourGlass timer<p>
    
<p>--->Feature List (prioritized list of features that can likely be delivered in the time allowed)<p>
    
<p>--->Future Feature List (non-prioritized list of end user features that would be implemented if there was more time)<p>
    
<p>--->Basic Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that demonstrates things you have learned in the class)<p>
    
<p>--->Advanced Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that go beyond what we learned in class)</p>
