    <h2>Team Members- Tony Morelli</h2>
    <h3>Application Overview</h3>

    <p>
        For this class project, I will be developing a unique countdown timer that 
        is implemented in the form of an hour glass.
        </p>
    
<p>--->Technology Overview (languages, libraries, platforms, hosting)- I originally planned to utilize python for my timer but then opted for a HTML and CSS alternative because I was running out of time.<p>
    
<p>--->Feature List (prioritized list of features that can likely be delivered in the time allowed)- This timers key features include a countown timer with a rotating hourglass with a realistic drip animation.<p>
    
<p>--->Future Feature List (non-prioritized list of end user features that would be implemented if there was more time)- If I had more time to work on this assignment, I would try to add some sort of christmas music, or I would add more intricate animation when my countdown timer concludes.<p>
    
<p>--->Basic Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that demonstrates things you have learned in the class) Some key technical features that I implemented that I learned in class are the basic html and css structure that were utilized in prior projects.  <p>
    
<p>--->Advanced Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that go beyond what we learned in class) Some key technical features that go beyond what we learned in class are the Keyframes transitions that were utilized for the falling snow animations along with the hourglass animations.</p>
